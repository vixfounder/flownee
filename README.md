# Flownee

**From what is on your mind to what makes sense next.**

Flownee is a calm, voice-first personal productivity PWA that turns spoken
everyday intentions into a continuously updated answer to:
**What should I do now?**

It was built from scratch for the OpenAI Build Week **Apps for Your Life**
track. Flownee is account-free, local-first, installable, and designed for
busy people who want guidance without maintaining another complicated
productivity system.

## Try Flownee

- Public application:
  [flownee-build-week.netlify.app](https://flownee-build-week.netlify.app)
- Judge testing guide and fictional input:
  [`TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Read-only fictional previews:
  [sample plan](https://flownee-build-week.netlify.app/?demo=sample),
  [updating](https://flownee-build-week.netlify.app/?demo=updating),
  [all complete](https://flownee-build-week.netlify.app/?demo=complete), and
  [loading](https://flownee-build-week.netlify.app/?demo=loading)

No account, payment, invitation, user API key, or preloaded personal data is
required. The fictional previews do not create or change local tasks; their
task actions are intentionally disabled.

## The problem

Small personal, household, family, shopping, social, and administrative
intentions are easy to remember at inconvenient moments and easy to forget
later. They are often too informal for a calendar, while manually categorizing
and prioritizing them in a traditional task manager creates more work.

Flownee reduces both kinds of friction:

1. Capture naturally by voice.
2. Review what was heard and how it was interpreted.
3. Let GPT-5.6 reason across the complete active set.
4. See one explained recommendation and a practical remaining order.
5. Complete, postpone, edit, or delete items and let the flow update.

## Core experience

- One-tap voice capture from the home screen.
- Editable GPT-4o Transcribe transcript before interpretation.
- Multiple intentions extracted from one recording.
- Editable titles and effort estimates before saving.
- Visible separation between user-stated facts, AI estimates, and assumptions.
- One prominent **Do this now** action with effort and a concise reason.
- Ordered **Next items in your current flow**.
- Complete, postpone, restore, edit, delete, clean-completed, and delete-all
  controls.
- Immediate local updates followed by automatic GPT-5.6 replanning.
- Last valid recommendation preserved during replanning or provider failure.
- IndexedDB persistence across refresh, close, reopen, and PWA use.
- Light and dark themes, responsive mobile-first UI, keyboard-accessible
  non-capture controls, reduced-motion handling, and installable PWA metadata.

## How the AI workflow works

```text
Microphone
  -> temporary browser audio Blob
  -> protected /api/transcribe route
  -> GPT-4o Transcribe
  -> editable transcript
  -> protected /api/plan route
  -> GPT-5.6 structured extraction and planning
  -> interpretation review
  -> atomic IndexedDB task + plan commit
  -> updated Do this now recommendation
```

### GPT-4o Transcribe

Audio is uploaded only after the user stops recording. The protected server
route validates the file type and size, applies a timeout and request limit,
and sends the recording to `gpt-4o-transcribe`. Flownee releases the temporary
audio after successful transcription and does not store recordings in its
durable local schema.

### GPT-5.6

The planning route uses `gpt-5.6-sol` with medium reasoning through the
Responses API. Strict Structured Outputs and a second semantic validation layer
require GPT-5.6 to return:

- extracted intentions with one visual emoji cue each;
- explicit effort and deadline provenance;
- visible assumptions and essential clarifications;
- a complete order containing every active task exactly once;
- one explained next action; and
- genuine parallel-work groups where appropriate.

A capture request includes only the confirmed transcript and a compact snapshot
of active tasks. A later replan includes active tasks but no transcript and is
not allowed to create new tasks. Completed history and unrelated local data are
excluded.

## Reliability and local-first design

Flownee treats AI as a fallible planning dependency, not as the source of truth
for user data.

- Confirmed transcripts can be saved independently of later planning.
- Task changes are committed locally before replanning begins.
- A monotonically increasing task revision rejects stale model responses.
- Invalid, incomplete, or inconsistent model output cannot replace a valid
  plan.
- A provisional local plan keeps the interface usable during replanning.
- Network or model failure never deletes a confirmed item or the previous
  valid plan.
- Opening the app loads from IndexedDB and does not call GPT-5.6 unless relevant
  task state changed.

## Privacy and operational boundaries

- No account or server-side task database.
- Confirmed transcripts, tasks, statuses, preferences, and plans remain in the
  current browser's IndexedDB.
- Audio is not retained after successful transcription by default.
- OpenAI credentials are server-only and never use a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.
- Paid routes enforce same-origin browser requests, input limits, provider
  timeouts, configurable best-effort throttling, and an emergency feature
  switch.
- Application logs exclude recordings, full transcripts, personal task
  contents, and secrets.
- The Help screen provides a two-step control that atomically deletes all local
  Flownee content.

Tasks do not synchronize between devices, browser applications, or browser
profiles. OpenAI processing requires a network connection; saved local content
remains available offline.

## Technology

| Area | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Application | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 6 |
| Interface | Tailwind CSS 4 and shadcn/ui-compatible primitives |
| Local persistence | Native IndexedDB with runtime record validation |
| Voice capture | Browser `MediaRecorder` with MIME negotiation |
| Transcription | GPT-4o Transcribe through a protected Next.js route |
| Reasoning | GPT-5.6 Responses API with strict Structured Outputs |
| PWA | Web manifest, owned icons, and API-bypassing service worker |
| Testing | Vitest, fake-indexeddb, component/contract/route tests |
| Hosting | Netlify |
| Package manager | pnpm 11 with a frozen lockfile |

Supabase, accounts, calendar integration, push notifications, background
listening, multi-device synchronization, routine learning, and location-aware
recommendations are deliberately outside the MVP.

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9 or newer
- pnpm 11
- An OpenAI API key only when exercising the live AI routes

### Install and run

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default example |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Server-only OpenAI credential | empty |
| `AI_FEATURES_ENABLED` | Emergency switch for both paid routes | `false` |
| `AI_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | Per-instance throttle window | `600` |
| `AI_TRANSCRIBE_RATE_LIMIT` | Transcription requests per client/window | `6` |
| `AI_PLAN_RATE_LIMIT` | Planning requests per client/window | `20` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` | Non-secret deployment label | `development` |

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AI_FEATURES_ENABLED=true` only in `.env.local` or the
deployment environment. Never commit a real key. With AI disabled, the local
shell, stored flow, task management, and fictional previews remain available;
new transcription and planning are intentionally paused.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

The current automated baseline is 35 test files and 130 passing tests. Coverage
includes IndexedDB transactions, stale-plan rejection, structured-output
contracts, provider boundaries, route validation, throttling, task actions,
home states, voice-state rendering, PWA metadata, and UI behavior.

fictional voice input, and delete-all procedure, follow
[`TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Platform evidence

Product-owner testing completed the public voice/AI journey, task actions,
individual editing/deletion, delete-all, reload, and reopen checks on:

- Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G in installed-app mode and current Chrome and Firefox.
- iPhone 17, iPhone 12, and iPhone 8 in current Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.

Windows Chrome-engine recording and responsive evidence is also documented.
Exact mobile OS/browser versions and per-browser MIME diagnostics were not
captured; Windows Chrome full-journey, macOS Chrome, and Windows Edge evidence
remain open. See
[`docs/technical/PLATFORM_TEST_MATRIX.md`](docs/technical/PLATFORM_TEST_MATRIX.md)
and
[`docs/technical/AUDIO_COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/technical/AUDIO_COMPATIBILITY.md)
for the precise claim boundaries.

## How the team collaborated with Codex

Codex was used throughout product definition, architecture, implementation,
testing, debugging, documentation, and release preparation. Under human
direction, Codex accelerated work by:

- translating the product brief and hackathon rules into a scoped execution
  plan and persistent repository guidance;
- implementing and testing the native IndexedDB schema, atomic repositories,
  task revisions, provisional plans, and stale-response protection;
- defining strict GPT-5.6 request/output contracts, prompts, semantic
  validation, and executable evaluation fixtures;
- building protected transcription and planning routes with safe provider
  error handling, timeouts, input limits, throttling, and feature controls;
- implementing the responsive voice, review, task-management, recovery,
  privacy, PWA, and accessibility states;
- diagnosing production same-origin behavior behind Netlify's reverse proxy;
- expanding automated coverage and repeatedly running lint, tests, TypeScript,
  production builds, browser checks, and deployment smoke checks; and
- maintaining dated task evidence, decision history, platform limitations, and
  judge-facing documentation.

Codex did not independently choose the product direction or approve releases.
Material changes were reviewed against explicit product-owner decisions, and
uncertain or unavailable evidence was recorded as such rather than invented.
The detailed collaboration record is in
[`docs/execution/CODEX_SESSION_LOG.md`](docs/execution/CODEX_SESSION_LOG.md).

## Decisions made by humans

Victoria and Mike retained ownership of the consequential product,
engineering, design, testing, and submission decisions, including:

- choosing the busy-adult problem, **Apps for Your Life** track, value
  proposition, research claim boundaries, and voice-first product direction;
- requiring voice-only capture with editable text review rather than adding a
  competing text-entry workflow;
- choosing account-free local persistence, no permanent audio retention, and
  no calendar, account, synchronization, reminder, routine-learning, or
  location scope for the MVP;
- selecting GPT-4o Transcribe, GPT-5.6, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind,
  shadcn/ui conventions, IndexedDB, Netlify, and the server-only API boundary;
- defining the calm, concise, non-judgmental tone and approving the brand,
  responsive layout, interaction hierarchy, effort options, animations, and
  final mobile experience;
- approving API-budget controls, model-quality assumptions, staged design
  gates, dependencies, assets, and every material release decision; and
- conducting physical-device product acceptance and owning the final
  usability, rights, compliance, video, and Devpost claims.
