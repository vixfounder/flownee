# Supported-platform test matrix

Last updated: 2026-07-20

This matrix separates measured evidence from assumptions. A responsive viewport
simulation is useful layout evidence, but it is not a physical-device or
browser-engine pass.

## Release journey

The supported-platform journey is:

1. Open the public HTTPS app without an account.
2. See the saved **What to do now** plan, or the first-run empty state.
3. Record a voice item and review the transcript.
4. Confirm the interpreted tasks and receive an updated execution plan.
5. Reload and confirm local data persists.
6. Complete, postpone, edit, and delete items.
7. Delete all local data from the privacy panel.

## Current evidence

| Platform | Support level | Evidence completed | Status | Remaining release evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows, current Chrome | Primary | Chrome 150 Chromium engine: responsive desktop/mobile layouts, IndexedDB journey, no horizontal overflow or console errors; real three-second microphone capture produced a 47,639-byte WebM/Opus Blob with one audio track. Installed Google Chrome is `150.0.7871.125`. | **Partial pass** | Repeat the complete journey in the installed Google Chrome executable against the public HTTPS deployment. |
| Android, current Chrome | Primary | Product-owner-reported physical testing on a Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G passed against the public deployment in installed-app mode and current Chrome. Recording, transcription, AI interpretation and replanning, review, all task actions, individual edit/delete, delete-all, reload, and reopen all worked as expected. Current Firefox also passed as additional evidence. | **Physical-device pass** | Exact Android/browser versions and per-browser MIME/Blob diagnostics were not captured. |
| macOS, current Chrome | Primary | No macOS device was available in this workspace. | **Not run** | Run the complete journey on a named macOS device and record exact Chrome/macOS versions. |
| Windows, current Edge | Secondary | Microsoft Edge `150.0.4078.83` is installed. No trustworthy interactive Edge run has been completed. | **Not run** | Run the complete journey in Edge against the public HTTPS deployment. |
| iPhone/iPad, current Safari | Best effort | Product-owner-reported physical testing on iPhone 17, iPhone 12, and iPhone 8 passed against the public deployment in current Safari. Recording, transcription, AI interpretation and replanning, review, all task actions, individual edit/delete, delete-all, reload, and reopen all worked as expected. Current Chrome and Firefox on the same iPhones also passed as additional browser-shell evidence. | **Best-effort physical-device pass** | Exact iOS/browser versions and per-browser MIME/Blob diagnostics were not captured; no iPad result is claimed. |

## Environment-independent verification

On localhost, `/`, `/?demo=sample`, `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/sw.js`,
`/diagnostics/recording`, and `/api/ai-status` each returned HTTP 200 on
2026-07-18. The manifest and service worker returned their expected content
types. The current automated baseline is 130 passing tests plus passing lint and
production build gates.

## Public deployment gate

The public deployment is available at
https://flownee-build-week.netlify.app. Signed-out HTTP checks passed on
2026-07-18 for `/`, `/?demo=sample`, `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/sw.js`,
`/icon.svg`, `/diagnostics/recording`, and `/api/ai-status`. The AI-status route
reported `enabled: true`; cross-origin POST requests to `/api/plan` and
`/api/transcribe` returned HTTP 403 before any provider call.

This closes the public hosting and account-free access gates. It does not close
the remaining Windows Chrome, macOS Chrome, or Windows Edge rows above. The
physical mobile results are product-owner-reported evidence; browser and OS
version numbers were not captured and must not be inferred.

## Evidence rules

- Record exact browser, operating-system, and device versions.
- Use fictional task content only.
- Do not retain or upload diagnostic recordings.
- Record failures and limitations; do not convert assumptions or emulation into
  passes.

  [`AUDIO_COMPATIBILITY.md`](AUDIO_COMPATIBILITY.md).
